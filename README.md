# Paroleball
This is an university project made for Phisics 2 of year 2 of Game Design and Development in the UPC.


## Differences with the main game.
  * There is no hole in the middle where the ball stops and shoots at enemies
  * No shooting enemy
  * no controller only support
  * 2 special features have been applied
  * No enemies
  * The side light switches don't light up, instead there are extra lights in fronts of them to signify that they are active
  * The kicker acts different than in the game itself
  * Sound effects and music are different

## Controls
  BASIC CONTROLS:
 
 * Left and Right Arrow to move the Flippers
 * Down Arrow to prepare the Kicker
 * Let go of Down Arrow to throw the kicker
 * When Dead: Up Arrow to Restart
